Migrate to Xcode5.02 and iOS 7
        - Managed object can not be put into array and pass to other function, especially in iOS, so changed AppDelegate to replace ATEventEntity to ATEventDataStruct in sortedEventList
        - DatePicker changes:
            . some neccessary style change for iOS7
            . improved way to dismiss keyboard for datepicker by move resignFirstRespond to valueChanged event
        - Enabled BC/AD, iOS7 fixed Era issue, so I simplified dateByAddingComponentsRegardingEra() function
        - Address Search box background color need change
        - Time wheel table background image issue 
        - Photo UIPageControl repositoned in storyboard in iOS7, have to remove it, and add to BasePhotoViewController again, then create outlet, change position hint so it will always located at bottom. (iOS fixed PageControl bug that need give initial page number to a big number 999)
        - Current Location need to move down a little in iOS 7
Xcode5 has issue. So I continues use Xcode4.6 to develope, but has issue connect to iPad with iOS7. The solution:
   - open Xcode5.02 while connect a iOS7 iPad
   - quite Xcode5.02 and open Xcode4, then we can see iPad name in schema dropdown for iPad
   
   
if get certificate expire error, go to https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/profile/profileList.action  and do:
  - clic "edit" for the expired profile
  - check the radio button for create certificate, then click enabled [Generate] button
  - in Xcode Organizer->Device, click [Refresh] button at the bottom right. 
    (Note: Click [Renew] button does not work, may be a Xcode bug. have to got to dev portal as described above)

Enhance Photo Scroll View and zoom photo (12/2013)
-------------------------
This is a very difficult task. example on Raywenlinch only zoom one photo, and scroll photos could not zoom.
Apple Scroller sample use UIPageView as root and I could not add my button.
Finally find a sample that changed Apple Scroller sample to use a UIViewController as root controller so I can add my buttons: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17171777/how-to-implement-uipageviewcontroller-with-a-uiscrollview/17207056#17207056

7/15/2013 Implement sync dropbox with my own way
---------
Did not use Dropbox new Sync API because it will too tightly couple user with Dropbox.
I used DBRestClient for iOS. This is asynchronize api, I implement it in my own way to simulate its execution in 
synchronous way but user still can interupt (I called my way Chain action)

6/23/2013  display multiple photo in EventEditor with Horizontal table
----------
. When done with photo picker, save to tmp file and added to photoList/photoNewAddedList
. PhotoViewerController should have a delete button, in deleteAction, remove entry from photolist/photoNewAddedList, and added entry to photoDeleteList
  Also should have a set default button so to generate a thumbnail for map view to show. The thumbnail photo is in event directory with name "thumbnail"
. pass photoNewAdded/delete list to mapView UpdateEvent, and iew UpdateEvent will save event first to get eventId (for new event), then save or remove files based on passed in email.
. Previously set photo to eventEditor's photoButton is in mapView, now removed it, instead let eventEditor to initialize photoList and show it in horizontal 


3/30/13  start to design/implement event photo in Virginia Beach 3-day vacation
---------------------------------------
As in my email on Mar 29, 2013, I want to change a little bit:
 - Do not consider synch photo to server, if user change device, all photo be lost.
   if user re-install ....
   Photo infor will be in a separate sqlite db without synch to server
   (wish to put into current sqllige, need to see if I can get path of the 
 - Later may have a separate version to synch photo

3/6/13 - Completed first version, but find need to use horizontal table for timeScrollWindow
--------------------
- Follow easyTableView example, my mapView Controller will be viewController for easyTableView.
- study UIScrollViewDelegate reference to see which event can used to decide when scroll stopped
- after stop, use following to get visible rows:
    NSArray *visible = [tableView indexPathsForVisibleRows];
    NSIndexPath *indexpath = (NSIndexPath*)[visible objectAtIndex:0];
        indexPath.row will give you index of first object displayed..Hope this help
- then try to snap the middle visible row to the middle of the screen as focusedDate


serverside has these action
---------------------------
ROOT: atlastimelineapi
- downloadjsoncontents - paramenter  user_id, security_code, atlas_name
- retreievelistofcontents  - paramenter   user_id, security_code
- verifyusersetup - parameter  user_id
- POST for upload: parameter user_id, security_code, json_contents


IOS Apple Sample code http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/
(I used WeatherMap example)

1. This is a navigator based application, created in following way:
    . create project with "Single view"
    . select storyboard file, then Editor->Embed In->Navigator..
    (this will change to navigator controller, now drop any view controller in storyboard will make them part of navigate)
  . add MapKits to first view
  . add Timeline button to first view's navigate bar
  . add searchBar to navigate bar is tricky:
        - new drop a view item to navigate bar, then drop searchBar
          on the view item
          (use search bar:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2281798/how-to-search-mkmapview-with-uisearchbar )
  . drop a TableView Controller to storyboard as the Timeline view
    (Later will new .h.m file for this table controller and associate both in Identity Inspector)
  . create segus from "Timeline button" to the second controller so click on it will switch to Timeline view table controller automatically
2. To see if a view item has connected with any var in code, open .h file and see if var has a filled circle. Click on the circle also will reveal the connction detail. 
    To make a view item connect to a var, open storyboard, open .h code in Editor at right, ctrl-drag the view item to .h file and a IBOutlet var will be created with filled circle.
    To remove a connection, in storyboard, control-click on a view item, in the popup, there is a small x, click it
    (REMEMBER Xcode use connection, while other technology such as .NET/Swing use view item ID in code directly)
    
3. Create ATimelineTableViewController class in File -> New ...
    Then in storyboard click TableViewControler and in Identity Inspector to associate it with the ATimelineTableViewController (may need restart Xcode if do not see the class in inspector)
4. 20130101 - today spent a long time to figure out why once worked code suddenly get error on dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:EventCellIdentifier returns nil.
   But when install on iPad works fine.
   I finally clean the project again and run on simulator works now. (weired, not know why. our cell is a prototype cell, in this case need set "EventCellIdentifier" in Attrib Inspector, if not will get above nil error, but I did it)
5. ####20130114 ##### finally solve the issue I've been working on for whole weelend: CLGeocoder object has to be initialize everytime use it. So it have to be initialized everytime in handleGesture()
6. modify code to be able to work on iOS5:
    . do not use NSAttributedString
    . do not use new form of dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier which has the second parameter


DATE format and localize Example
---------------------------------
        NSString *date = [NSDateFormatter localizedStringFromDate: [NSDate date]
                                                        dateStyle:NSDateFormatterShortStyle 
                                                        timeStyle:NSDateFormatterShortStyle];
                                                        
Sync Server Chinese character issue
------------------------------------
At iOS side, when do JSON serilize, use NSUTF8StringEncoding (not NSACCII...)
Most work is at MySql and Spring MVC, please refere to text document in atlasTimeline Spring MVC Eclipse project on dropbox 

Use Protocal/Delegate etc to pass data btw views. If a view is in storyborder, then definitly have to use delegate, can not use member. For example, EventEditor access ATViewController members through delegate, could not do following:
        - EventEditory.h   ATViewController* parent
        - ATViewController.m   eventEditor = .....;
        
                               eventEditor.parent = self;
(Should use block, see IOS 6 Tutorial I bought from Raywen....)
------------------------------------------------
    Use UsingDelegateComplete proj to see how to pass data btw mapview and popover view. (detail at http://www.colejoplin.com/2012/09/12/ios-tutorial-combining-delegation-storyboards-popovers-and-data/ )
    Here popover view and main view (which will be mapview in our case) will pass data to eachother:
        From Main View to Popup View used sequs thus UIPopoverControllerDelegate is used to pass data to Popview.
        From PopView to Main View used button action, a customized protocal is defined to pass data through a delegate.

Issues taken long time:
------------------
1. After migrate table section sample TVAnimationGestures, click on section does call toogleOpen handler, then found need copy carat*.png file.
2. finally solve the issue I've been working on for whole weelend: CLGeocoder object has to be initialize everytime use it. So it have to be initialized everytime in handleGesture()
3. What is Navigator Conroller and Push segue only works for Controller managed by NavController. Push Segue will make child controller automatically to have a NavControlBar with back button
4. AD/BC NSDate representation take me long time. IOS has issue with it. Finally find a solution (see dateByAddingComponentsRegardingEra function I got from the internet). This save me time and made historical document possible (2013-02-05)
5. Add searchBar on Navigator bar is very tricky:
    . add a UIView first, then put searchBar in it. But the size is small, reason is it is put into navigator's titleView, so need make titleView size big:
      [self.navigationItem.titleView setFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 300, 30)]
6. Upload to Spring MVC failed. then find reason: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" is used, need encode % and & sign (spend long time to figure out)

Core Data
----------
Follow http://www.raywenderlich.com/934/core-data-on-ios-5-tutorial-getting-started
step 1 tutor only.(Step 2 is preload date, step 3 is about NSFetchedResultsController which is a advanced feature to make table view only fetch data in the view.)

But I also want to follow 2ndApp.Storyboard doc's example to have a BirdsightingDataController instead of put code in AppDelegate.

Navigator/Segue/Controller etc
------------------------------
Use Navigator Controller as much as possible since its impl will be same for iPad and iPhone, and we can take advantage of the automatically generated back button back to parent view with Push seque.
For iPad if sub-view is too big, then have to use popover/Modal etc to bring up smaller sub-view. but inside the smaller sub-views, use second Navigator Controller to navigate further sub-views
(NOTE: Push segue is only for views managed by Navigator Controler)
 
-- My Preference Window: follow iOS5 Tutor: (based on views managed by NavigatorController, see P136, P166)
   My root mapView/Timeline view is managed by root Navigator.
   For iPad, I want popover the setting view, and subsequently subview in Navigator style.
   For iPhone, it easy, just create Push Seque from Setting Button to preference view and use Push seque for all sub-views, the will all have back button managed by root nabigatorController.
   Here is what I do in iPad Storyboard:
        I want my preference views in another Navigator Controller tree, so did this:
        - drag a new Navigator Controller, make the comming TableController as Preference main view
        - make a Popover segue from Setting button to the new NavigatorController.
        - then use Push segue for all sub-views
        (All view controller must set same explicit size in attribute editor)
          
-- Popover/Modal Event Editor
   1. iPad has to use iPad specific UIPopoverController. This controller can wrap any View Controller such as Table View Controller. 
      After study many posts, I finally can combine them to impl in following way without use segue 
     (later I found iOS5 Tutor Ppage180 has a way to create seque for accessory buttons, but I still kept following way):
        - Design a Table View Controller on storyboard to layout my event editor, gieve a id to this view on storyboard as "event_edit_id", make it to be class of ATEventEditTableViewController
        - in CalloutAccessoryControlTapped():
            . instance a EventEditor view controller from storyboard
            . instance a UIPopoverControler to wrap the above EventEditor view controller instance
            . use presentPopoverFromRect (not presentPovopverFromButton) to start display popover
        - Dismiss popover is different to dismiss other view controller. Dismiss popover have to use delegate from main controller not from popover itself.
            see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5922254/how-to-dismiss-uipopover-from-a-button-in-the-popover
   2. iPhone should be easy: just create Push segue to CalloutAccessoryControlTapped, it will be managed by root NavigatorController. (either programmally as I did for iPad, or the way I found later in iOS5 Tutor Page180 to drag segue from view itself (see iOS5 tutoron p180 last hightlight) storyboard from annotation)

-- The way to get image picker (camera/cameraroll)
(Need add MobileCoreService.framework in Build Phases -> Link Binary with ....)
    follow http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/An_Example_iOS_4_iPad_Camera_and_UIImagePickerController_Application_(Xcode_4)
    for ipad/iPhone do differently:
    . iPad
        try to start as modal view
    
    . iPhone
        easy, just use main navigator

-- HelpWebView should be part of main navigator, so need add extra button to main navigator bar. After iOS5, a easy way is provided to add more button to navigator bar (which only has right, title, left). 


Use TableView Static Cell for layout, and use Group style
------------------------------------
see iOS5 tutor p159
The EventEditor view I designed above is a TableViewController with Static Cell


The beauty of the using table view's static cell for iPad/iPhone is that we can design same tableViewController on storyboard with Static cell for layout the popover view, and iPad PopoverController can wrap it in code, iPhone can create a NavigatorViewController to wrap it with Modal segue (need more study how to start from annotation view in iPone)

Following is mapView related
------------------------------------
(#### ATViewController.h must conform to <MKMapViewDelegate> ##### for annotation)

Step 1: Add Use long-press gesture to add map pin/annotation
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4317810/how-to-capture-tap-gesture-on-mkmapview  
    (Need to make a mapview outlet from Stroryboard to ATViewController)

Step 2: Have a custom annotation with accessory button
    http://blog.asolutions.com/2010/09/building-custom-map-annotation-callouts-part-2/
    (also see project MapCallout prject)

Step 3: How to show popover from accessory button
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5582564/how-do-i-display-a-uipopoverview-as-a-annotation-to-the-map-view-ipad
    Three type of annotView has been defined, implement viewForAnnotation(), which is part of MKMapViewDelegate protocol, to get right type of view to display or add accessory button.
    Implement calloutAccessoryControlTapped if an accessory button clicked to openup popover view. post at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8112515/using-segue-from-mapview-calloutaccessorycontroltapped help to understand how to use segue to popup the view
    Following "Use Protocal/Delegate ..." will help to understand how to pass data btw mapviews and popover

IOS Apple Sample code http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/
  MapCallout - example to have custom pin and callout
  WeatherMap - Core Data and Map Annotation
  
-- Example for GeoCoder http://jonathanfield.me/jons-blog/clgeocoder-example.html
     The above code example also illustrate how to start for iphone/ipad in appDelegate
-- Search on Map with SearchBar
     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2281798/how-to-search-mkmapview-with-uisearchbar
     Look for Apple Map service (Skip Google service part)
-- About Annotation and AnnotationView on map
   Map Annotation has two components: MKAnnotation for data and MKAnnotationView for display part
   MKPointAnnotation is a default implementation of MKAnnotation with only tile and subtitle
   MKPinAllocationView is a default implementatin of MKAnnotationview
   Eachtime add/update an anotation, viewForAnnotation will be called to fetch a view, this is part of <MapViewDelegate> protocol
   Eachtime click on a pin on map, didSelectAnnotationView will be called with the clicked annotationView.
   AnnotationView can have a button defiend to call calloutAccessoryControlTapped when tapped.
