Use ADClusterMapView to replace MKMapView
------------------------------------------
( https://github.com/applidium/ADClusterMapView/blob/master/README.md )
1. Storyboard need change to use ADClusterMapView instead of MKMapView
2. ATViewController.h need change
3. ATViewController.h need to change addAnnotation to setAnnotation
   AND need to add all annotation in a array, not currently one by one
4. Can not add extra annotation in this version, so no focused row
5. somehow an exception weired exception, I coment out a line in
    clusterAnnotationForOriginalAnnotation()
   (when debug, it is correct, but not know why it get assert error)


new version
------------
1. Hide tmpLbl (set alpha=0.2) in hide mode (when eventListView.alpha < 1)
2. reduce tmpLbl size (too big before, especially when on iPhone)
3. Change behave of hiding event list view: leave small portion of it visible for better user experience


version 2.03 (released in Nov, 2015)
------------
1. use ADClusterMapView. But still have some small bug:
    . ocassionally, start event editor will have no contents
    . in map zoon level 1 or 2, viewForAnnotation() have annotation with nil cluster (I belive is ADClusterMapView bug),
      I got around this by use white flag or small red dot
2. Fixed event editor popup view description width



Version 2.02 (released Oct, 2015)
------------
Migrate to Xcode7:
    1)remove senTestingKit
    2)disable bitcode in buildSettings
    3)remove init for Activity but can not send email does not work, need study
    4)http does not work anymore, need do: Configuring App Transport Security Exceptions in iOS 9 and OSX 10.11
5) Big issue with iOS 9: (want to release with following outstanding issue)
- tmpLbl will not show, found fitToSize() will make width 0, fixed by add labelHeight var
- now tmpLbl does show, but click on tmpLbl the popup eventEditor show wrong place. Fixed by pass touch.view to startEventEditor:(UIView*)
- Not Fixed: max/min event editor will crash in createPhotoScrollView() when get whId.
The reason is eventEditor.description (and others) are nil after call popover in following flow:
    sizeButtonAction() -> delegate.restartEditor() -> startEventEditor()
       ... self.eventEditorPopover presentPopoverFromRect ...
    usually after it, self.eventEditor.description will not be nil, but if come from sizeButtonAction, after above presentPopoverFromRect, self.eventEditor.description will be still nil
    By uncomments "if self.eventEditor == nil", eventEditor.description etc will be better (min-to-max works, but max-min will have untraceable crash [** A **]), but photoScrollView will have issue
[** A **] crash info:
UIPopoverPresentationController (<UIPopoverPresentationController: 0x149179b80>) should have a non-nil sourceView or barButtonItem set before the presentation occurs

Version 2.01 (released Heritage on oct 5)
------------
1. Add World Herigate target
2. Replicate new fundtionality from CM: hide menu when scroll map
3. Add Language selection


version 2.0  (released, started around 3/20/2015)
-----------
Release with xcode 5, xcode 6 still have max/min editor problem
- Major interface over-haul:
. change all icons to be iOS 7 look-and-feel
. Animated show/hide objects when tap on map, also change 3-step show/hide to 2-step
. Improved and simplified time wheel visual effect by removed border and gap.
. Removed dark border around address search box


Version 1.3.1
    - Fix event editor min/max bug
    - display related Chronicle Map in Chinese as 霞客行

version 1.3
    - Scroll map in camera mode when jump to another location, greatly enhance user experience on map.
    - improve event list text readability by differing text darkness for date, title and content.
    - Use text button to emphasis event list mode: timewheel or map mode.
    - improve map mode eventview refresh loop performance
    - Related apps list is from server.
    - use a UIView to do photo description editor, removed a third party customizealertview for photo desc editor
    - Improve select on event list view to make sure everytime will show thumbnail
    - Tried hard to automatically switch event list view mode and give up. The main problem is in automatic mode, each time scroll map will cause many executions such as refresh event list view, very soon the memory warning will occure frequently. I tried to use timer or time delay technic, but always has glitch.
    - xcode6 does not work for min/max event editor etc


#### Photos are linked to GoogleDriver PhotosForWWII directory.####

#### In author mode, copy from GoogleDriver to Dropbox ChronicleReader/myEvents ####

Test overlay
Think of photo flag (eventType), should scan again to set it by checking if directory exist
EventEditor allow save for photo only, add an "Full" button
Focuse: remove focuse button, every time click marker will forcuse automatically, same as select on event list view
Add "Author Area" in manual to download file, Web-based upload file to "aaa@bb.com" directory
Instruction to author contents and send photos


Restrictions: 
    mostly cased by using date as nuiqueId that could cause detached photos if author modified date in new version


Next version should allow user to choose file to validate the contents the authored. may be the only way is to use dropbox file chooser framework.
